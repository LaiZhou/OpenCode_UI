## 1.0.9

- Fix: In Project View `Opt+Cmd+K` (`Ctrl+Alt+K`), selecting a directory now sends the directory path (for example `@src/module`) instead of expanding and sending all child file paths.
- Improvement: Added selection normalization for mixed Project View payloads (directory + descendants) to preserve context semantics and avoid noisy prompts.
